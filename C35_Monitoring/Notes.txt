C35_Monitoring
# Description: The monitor performs the following:
1. On initialization, computes statistics for the given behavior tree which include success probabilities and time distributions given success/failure.
2. During runtime, the C35 node listens to messages from executor, and maintains statistics regarding succ/fail and execution times of all nodes in the BTree.
3. When running a Monitoring task (e.g., MonitorTime(param=563a39ca-99df-45dc-a369-73c7af2fe951)), the task monitors the node with the id given in param. If the node takes longer than (T*average_computed_time) for that node, it exists with failure, which terminates the monitored node (the monitoring node is always the monitored node's sibling in the BTree, and their parent is always a parallel node).


How to Check:

============
Requires python ver 2.7.3. In order to test the code run the following:
1. Launch drc sim
2. run designer and executer
3. rosrun C46_MountVehicle C46_Node.py
4. rosrun C35_Monitoring C35_Node.py, in  C35_Node, make sure that you sent the right xml file. for example: MonitorTimeServer("tests/simple_monitor_example.xml", "MonitorTime")
5. in designer load tree located in C35_monitoring/src/tests/simple_monitoring_example.xml. IF THE DESIGNER REFUSES, MOVE FILE TO C34_Designer/plans/ )
6. run the tree, resume

How to Check (skill4) (oudated):
============
Requires python ver 2.7.3. In order to test the code run the following:
1. Launch drc sim
2. run designer and executer
3. run all relevant nodes for skill4
4. rosrun C35_Monitoring C35_Node.py
5. in designer load tree located in C35_monitoring/src/tests/skill4.xml
6. run the tree

Known Bugs:
==========


Known Limitations:
=================
xml file is hardcoded, instead of being given as cmd line argument.

MONITOR WAYPOINT OF DRIVING MODULE

# Description: This monitor works in parallel to "WayPointsDriving" in C51_CarOperation.
Performs the following:
1. Saves the way points sent by the path planner and the current location passed by the vehicle.
2. Compares the vehicle's real location to the accurate way point and calculates the gap.
3. Check whether the current driving module run has passed the threshold, if so, produces an alert.

How to Check:
============
Requires python ver 2.7.3. , drc-2.0 and gazebo-1.4.0 and up.
In order to test the code run the following:
1.C0_Scripts/clear_all.sh
2.C0_Scripts/make_all.sh
3. follow the instructions in: http://www.robil.org/trac_robil/wiki/WalkingdexterityPage to upload the C51_CarOperation module.
  3.1. in C51_CarOperation: rosrun C51_CarOperation DRC_Vehicle_Init_client.py
  3.2. continue to run C51_CarOperation in stage 9
4. rosrun C34_Designer run.sh
5. rosrun C35_Monitoring C35_Node.py
6. rosrun C34_Executer executer
7. in designer, open tree located in C35_monitoring/src/tests/plan26-02-13-131747286.xml  (IF THE DESIGNER REFUSES, MOVE FILE TO C34_Designer/plans/ )
8. run the tree, resume.
9. in C51_CarOperation: rosrun C51_CarOperation DRC_Vehicle_Drive_client.py

Known Limitations:
=================
TODO - Need to get threshold function from Oded.
TODO - Need to formalize the alerts raised by the monitor




=======================
Timeout Monitor, Falling Monitor, and Stability Monitor
=======================
#description (Timeout Monitor): a task which receives as a parameter a threshold value, and after threshold seconds, aborts with failure, unless preempted.
#description (Falling Monitor): a task which listens on topic /C35/falling for boolean values [0,1], and aborts with failure when 1 is heard (meaning the robot has fallen).
#description (Stability Monitor): a task which listens on topic /C35/stability for int8 values [1-5] (5 being the most stable), and aborts with failure when 1 is heard (meaning the robot is dangerously unstable).
in order to run test (requires stand_up module):
roslaunch atlas_utils atlas.launch
rosrun C34_Executer executer
rosrun C34_Designer run.sh 
rosrun C35_Monitoring TimeoutMonitor.py
rosrun C35_Monitoring FallingMonitor.py
rosrun C35_Monitoring StabilityMonitor.py
rosrun C48_StandUp Fall.py
rosrun C48_StandUp C48_StandUp.py
C34_Designer/plans/MonitoredStandUp.xml
run and resume
threshold values can be changed in the xml files, just change the threshold parameters.
"falling messages" can be sent from command line using: rostopic pub -1 /C35/falling std_msgs/Bool -- 1
"stability messages" can be sent from command line using: rostopic pub -1 /C35/stability std_msgs/Int8 -- [1-5]

Known Bugs:
==========


Known Limitations:
=================
Not related to monitoring, but stand_up module does not react to preemption.
